### Hi there fellow Coders ðŸ‘‹

I'm a graduate from the University of Massachusetts Lowell with a Bachelor's in Computer Science. I primarily write code in Java & JavaScript for work, but also have experience in Python & C++, RobotFramework, and SQL. I use GitHub to work on projects for myself and for school!
